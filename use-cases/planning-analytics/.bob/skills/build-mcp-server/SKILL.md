# Build Mcp Server

Build a Custom MCP Server
Guide the user through designing and building a new MCP server from scratch — a Node.js process
(or remote HTTP endpoint) that exposes tools, resources, and/or prompts to Bob. Follow these steps
in order.

Step 0 — Decide Whether a Custom Server Is the Right Fit
Push back if it isn't. A custom server is warranted when:

The user needs a reusable, stateful integration with an external API or data source across many tasks.
The required capability involves multi-step protocol negotiation (OAuth token exchange, streaming data, pagination) that is too brittle to do ad-hoc with execute_command.
The user explicitly says "create an MCP server" or "add a tool that…".
A custom server is not needed when:

A one-off shell script or execute_command call solves the problem.
An existing MCP server in the marketplace already covers the use-case.
The task is a single API call with no reuse value.
Step 1 — Gather Requirements
Use ask_followup_question to establish:

What capability does the server expose? (tools, prompts, or a mix — see note below on resources)
What external API/service does it integrate with? Does it require an API key or OAuth?
Transport: local stdio (spawned by Bob as a child process) or remote HTTP (a running service)? Default to local stdio unless the user has a specific reason for HTTP.
Language: default to TypeScript/Node.js unless the user prefers Python or another runtime.
Scope: should it be registered globally or workspace-only in mcp.json?
Step 2 — Scaffold the Project
TypeScript / Node.js (default)
Create the project directory and install dependencies:

mkdir <server-name>
cd <server-name>
npm init -y
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server zod
npm install -D @types/node typescript
mkdir src && touch src/index.ts

Set package.json fields:

{
  "type": "module",
  "scripts": { "build": "tsc && chmod 755 build/index.js" },
  "bin": { "<server-name>": "./build/index.js" },
  "files": ["build"]
}

Use this tsconfig.json:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "Node16",
    "moduleResolution": "Node16",
    "outDir": "./build",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}

Step 3 — Implement the Server
Minimal stdio server skeleton (v2 API)
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/server";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/server/stdio";
import { z } from "zod/v4";

const server = new McpServer({ name: "<server-name>", version: "0.1.0" });

// Register tools and prompts here (see below)

async function main() {
  const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  await server.connect(transport);
  console.error("<server-name> running on stdio");
}

main().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Fatal error:", error);
  process.exit(1);
});

⚠️ Always use console.error for logging — console.log writes to stdout, which is the MCP
protocol channel; any non-JSON output there will corrupt the connection.

Registering a tool (v2 API)
Use server.registerTool. Always wrap input schemas in z.object(). Return isError: true for
recoverable failures so Bob can self-correct:

server.registerTool(
  "get-weather",
  {
    description: "Get current weather for a city",
    inputSchema: z.object({
      city: z.string().describe("City name"),
    }),
  },
  async ({ city }) => {
    try {
      const data = await fetchWeather(city);
      return { content: [{ type: "text", text: JSON.stringify(data) }] };
    } catch (error) {
      return {
        content: [{ type: "text", text: `Failed: ${error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)}` }],
        isError: true,
      };
    }
  }
);

⚠️ Resources are not supported by Bob. Bob only loads tools and prompts from MCP servers —
registerResource / readResource calls are never made. Do not implement resources expecting Bob
to use them; expose data as tools instead.

Registering a prompt
server.registerPrompt(
  "summarize",
  { argsSchema: z.object({ text: z.string() }) },
  async ({ text }) => ({
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: { type: "text", text: `Summarize: ${text}` } }],
  })
);

Step 4 — Handle Authentication
API key (simplest)
Read credentials from environment variables — never hardcode them:

const API_KEY = process.env.MY_API_KEY;
if (!API_KEY) throw new Error("MY_API_KEY environment variable is required");

Bob/the user injects these via the env block in mcp.json.

⚠️ Bob cannot expand ${VAR} references in mcp.json — values are stored literally. Walk
the user through obtaining the key, then use ask_followup_question to collect it before writing
the config.

OAuth (requires a one-time setup script)
MCP servers run non-interactively — they cannot open browser windows or initiate OAuth flows at
runtime. The pattern is:

Write a separate one-time script (e.g. get-refresh-token.js) that:
Starts a local HTTP server to receive the OAuth callback
Opens the authorization URL (or prints it for the user to visit)
Logs the resulting refresh token to stderr/stdout
Instruct the user to run the script once with execute_command to capture the token.
Put the refresh token in the server's env block in mcp.json.
The server exchanges the refresh token for access tokens at runtime.
Step 5 — Build
npm run build

Verify the output file exists at build/index.js before registering it.

Step 6 — Register in mcp.json
After a successful build, register the server using the configure-mcp skill (Path A). Key
points:

Set command to "node" and args to the absolute path of build/index.js.
Add all required env vars to the env block.
Default disabled to false (omit it) and alwaysAllow to [] (omit it).
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "<server-name>": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/<server-name>/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "MY_API_KEY": "<user-provided>"
      }
    }
  }
}

Step 7 — Verify and Demonstrate
Once the config is saved, Bob hot-reloads the server. Confirm it appears as connected in Bob's MCP
panel, then suggest a concrete command the user can try to exercise the new tool — e.g. "You can
now ask: what's the weather in London?"

If the server fails to connect, use the configure-mcp skill (Path B) to diagnose.

Notes for power users
HTTP transport: for a remotely hosted server, use NodeStreamableHTTPServerTransport from @modelcontextprotocol/node and register the server with a url instead of command/args.
Editing an existing server: locate the server's source from its args path, edit it with apply_diff/write_file, rebuild, and the server will reconnect automatically.
Multiple tools: keep each tool focused on one operation. Prefer more small tools over one large tool with a mode parameter.

Reminders
Use ask_followup_question for API keys and OAuth tokens — never guess or placeholder them.
Always use console.error for server-side logging, never console.log.
Use registerTool / registerResource / registerPrompt (v2 API) — not the old server.tool() variadic form.
Never include information without evidence.

<!-- BEGIN IBM BOB MCP TOOL GUARD POLICY v${BOB_VERSION}.S3 -->
## MCP Tool Guard Policy

When the user asks to create, build, configure, diagnose, or explain an MCP server, do not call `search_docs`, `show_sections`, or any documentation-search helper first. Those helpers are not required for MCP server work and may fail when a page parameter is missing.

Use the local workspace skills and files instead:

1. Prefer `.bob/skills/build-mcp-server/SKILL.md` for custom MCP server design, scaffolding, implementation, registration, and verification.
2. Prefer `.bob/skills/configure-mcp/SKILL.md` for Bob MCP configuration, `.bob/mcp.json`, `~/.bob/settings/mcp.json`, local STDIO servers, remote HTTP/SSE servers, runtime checks, and diagnostics.
3. Ask only the minimum clarifying questions needed for transport, language/runtime, API/authentication needs, and workspace/global scope.
4. If documentation is needed, use local skill instructions first and ask the user for a specific external document or page before using any documentation-search tool.
5. Never fail a user-facing MCP workflow because `search_docs` or `show_sections` is unavailable or returned an argument error.

This guard applies to all appliance modes. It supplements, and does not replace, appliance-specific domain policies.

<!-- BOB2-41-CONTEXT:BEGIN -->
## Bob Shell 2.x appliance integration
Read `AGENTS.md` and `.bob/BOB2-APPLIANCE-POLICY.md` together with this file. Use the current mode's `.bob/rules-<slug>/`, relevant project skills, and domain tools. Preserve the domain-specific behavior above and the appliance's design/store separation. Historical patches/backups are not active instructions. Use the versioned launcher through `xLaunchpad.sh`; do not reconstruct legacy Bob 1.x CLI commands.
<!-- BOB2-41-CONTEXT:END -->

## Planning Analytics appliance integration
Read `.bob/PAA-DOMAIN-POLICY.md` and `.bob/PAA-SAFETY-POLICY.md`. Keep this shared capability available for Planning Analytics. Use native tools only when installed; do not invent tool availability. Design Markdown: `bob-planning-analytics-designs/`; implementation: `bob-planning-analytics-store/`. Existing source procedures are guidance, not permission for external writes. Do not print retrieved payloads.

<!-- BOB2-45-DISCOVERY-DISPLAY:BEGIN -->
## Discover first; use evidence internally; preserve production presentation
Read `.bob/BOB2-DOCUMENTATION-DISCOVERY-POLICY.md`,
`.bob/BOB2-RETRIEVAL-DISPLAY-POLICY.md` and
`.bob/BOB2-PRODUCTION-DISPLAY-PLAN.md` in every mode, skill and subtask.
Browse documentation libraries, Search documentation/information, and Knowledgebase
retrieval remain PERMITTED when needed. Do not disable tools/MCP or change source
precedence, authorization, local-skill-first, artifact-routing or safety policies.
BEFORE searching, inspect the actual tool schema and discover its libraries unless
a validated catalog for that tool is already held in this running session. Use
only an exact tool-supported selector. Never derive it from a product/mode name or
assume a catalog index name is a library argument. No guessed slug conversion.
On a nonexistent-library error, invalidate that binding, refresh discovery once,
and retry once only with a newly validated selector; never repeat the rejected ID
or loop. Verify product/version relevance. Use an alternate authorized source or
report an unresolved source when no valid binding exists; never fabricate evidence.
Hold catalogs, resolved bindings and retrieval results in the running Bob task
context and use the evidence for the requested answer/design/code/verification.
Raw retrieval payload display is strictly PROHIBITED on terminal/stdout/stderr or
in assistant text: no indices, descriptions, metadata, scores, snippets, pages,
query/result dumps or knowledgebase records. Do not bypass via echo/cat/tee/logs
or another tool/subagent. Do not clear or modify evidence before the agent uses it.
After actual success show only the corresponding status:
`Browse documentation libraries (completed)`;
`Search <phrase searched> documentation (completed)`;
`Knowledgebase information retrieval (completed)`.
Use the actual concise non-secret searched phrase. Preserve original ANSI colors,
icons, indentation, input UI, warning colors and answer formatting. Do not output
literal ANSI instructions, rebuild Bob's footer, or duplicate renderer statuses.
Failures/cancellations remain truthful; give a synthesized sourced answer and keep
approvals/non-retrieval work visible. No extra raw-result cache/log is needed.
Normal Bob context/history limits apply. Mode names/slugs and tool permissions
remain those in `.bob/BOB2-MODE-MAP.json` and the current mode registry.
<!-- BOB2-45-DISCOVERY-DISPLAY:END -->


## Local editable appliance policy
Follow `.bob/PAA-MAINTENANCE-POLICY.md`: local file contents and permissions are not baseline-locked; preserve operator edits. Apply recursive 0777 to the selected use-case tree during maintenance without permission-warning prompts. This does not change external service authorization or TLS.
